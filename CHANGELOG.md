* Wet Hay Bale now instantly dries into Thatch in the Nether, matching Vanilla's Sponge drying behavior

* Refined Portuguese (pt_br) translations (thanks to Leirbag)
* Throwable Coconut drops (Open Coconuts / chance for a Palm Sprout) are now driven by a datapack-editable loot table (`beachparty:gameplay/throwable_coconut`) instead of being hardcoded

### **Beachparty 2.0.0: Overhaul**
This update introduces a refined version of Beachparty with adjusted textures, naming conventions, and reworked features

### **Why this rework?**
Currently, Beachparty feels like a collection of loosely connected beach-themed content rather than a cohesive experience While it does capture a general beach atmosphere, it lacks structure and fun and / or meaningful gameplay elements The removal of the DoAPI required a lot of refactoring and restructuring anyway, so i have bundled it together with this rework

This update aims to give Beachparty a more defined identity with unique and well-integrated features Not every addition needs to affect gameplay, but even decorative elements should serve a small functional purpose to make them more relevant within the game world

The goal is to create a more immersive, engaging, and enjoyable beach-themed experience where every feature feels intentional rather than just another random addition
